          "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and blindness across the world. The main objective of this work is to build a stable and noise-compatible system for the detection of diabetic retinopathy. This project employs deep learning methodology to detect diabetic retinopathy based on severity levels (No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR). To address the DR detection problem, which is a primary cause of blindness, early detection is critical. For this purpose, we used the deep learning architecture Inception v3. The model is evaluated with various metrics, and considering the dataset's complexity, the results are satisfactory. (This model has been employed on the web using Flask.)",

        "This project illustrates the design and implementation of a Lane and Vehicle Detection system. It is associated with Saraswati Education Society's Saraswati College of Engineering, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai. The system focuses on lane detection, including the localization of the road and the determination of the relative position between the vehicle and the road. The project utilizes OpenCV for detecting road boundaries and lanes using a vision-based approach capable of real-time operation. Lanes are extracted using triangles fitted to the edges and the Hough Transform method. This detection system works on painted, curved, and straight roads and has proven to be robust and efficient in real-time experiments.",
